# README

This is a simple Trello like app.

The goal of the project is to implement something similar to the basic functionality of Trello.
- add boards
- add columns on a board (each column will have a name)
- add tasks on a column (each task will have a title)
- data is persisted in a DB (sqlite in this case)

- allows moving columns around on a board (is persisted in DB)
- allows moving tasks in a column (is persisted in DB)
- allows moving a task to a different column (is persisted in DB)
- login/register
